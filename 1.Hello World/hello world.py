#Welcome
#Python is a programming language. Like other languages, it gives us a way to communicate ideas.
#In the case of a programming language, these ideas are “commands” that people use to communicate with a computer!

#Change Codecademy to your name in the script to the right. Run the code to see what it does!
#As soon as you’re ready, move on to the next exercise to begin learning to write your own Python programs!
