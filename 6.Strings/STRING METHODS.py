# 1.Introduction
# Python comes with built-in string methods that give you the power to perform complicated tasks on
# strings very quickly and efficiently. These string methods allow you to change the case of a string, split a string
# into many smaller strings, join many small strings together into a larger string, and allow you to neatly combine
# changing variables with string outputs.

# String methods all have the same syntax:string_name.string_method(arguments)
