# 1. Setting Up Our Robot
# Create a python class called DriveBot. Within this class, create instance variables for motor_speed, sensor_range, and direction. All of these should be initialized to 0 by default. 
# After setting up the class, create an object from the class called robot_1. Set the motor_speed to 5, the direction to 90, and the sensor_range to 10. 
# Use the provided print statements to check your work!

# Define the DriveBot class here!
class DriveBot:
    def __init__(self):
      self.motor_speed = 0
      self.direction  = 0
      self.sensor_range  = 0

robot_1 = DriveBot()
robot_1.motor_speed = 5
robot_1.direction = 90
robot_1.sensor_range = 10

print(robot_1.motor_speed)
print(robot_1.direction)
print(robot_1.sensor_range)
