# 1. Setting Up Our Robot
# Create a python class called DriveBot. Within this class, create instance variables for motor_speed, sensor_range, and direction. All of these should be initialized to 0 by default. 
# After setting up the class, create an object from the class called robot_1. Set the motor_speed to 5, the direction to 90, and the sensor_range to 10. 
# Use the provided print statements to check your work!

# Define the DriveBot class here!
class DriveBot:
    def __init__(self):
      self.motor_speed = 0
      self.direction  = 0
      self.sensor_range  = 0

robot_1 = DriveBot()
robot_1.motor_speed = 5
robot_1.direction = 90
robot_1.sensor_range = 10

print(robot_1.motor_speed)
print(robot_1.direction)
print(robot_1.sensor_range)

# 2. Adding Robot Logic
# In the DriveBot class, add a method called control_bot which accepts parameters: new_speed and new_direction. These should replace the associated instance variables.
# Create another method called adjust_sensor which accepts a parameter called new_sensor_range which replaces the sensor_range instance variable. 
# Afterwards, use these methods to rotate the robot 180 degrees at 10 miles per hour with a sensor range of 20 feet. Use the provided print statements to check your code!
class DriveBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.motor_speed = 0
        self.direction = 0
        self.sensor_range = 0
    
    # Add the methods here!
    def control_bot(self,new_speed, new_direction):
        self.motor_speed = new_speed
        self.direction = new_direction

    def adjust_sensor(self,new_sensor_range):
        self.sensor_range = new_sensor_range

robot_1 = DriveBot()
# Use the methods here!
robot_1.control_bot(10,180)
robot_1.adjust_sensor(20)

print(robot_1.motor_speed)
print(robot_1.direction)
print(robot_1.sensor_range)
